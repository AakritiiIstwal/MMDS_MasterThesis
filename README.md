# MMDS_MasterThesis
:butterfly: This repository maintains the code for Master Thesis at Universit√§t Mannheim. The thesis is conducted under the chair of Artificial Intelligence and focuses on audio processing. The aim of the thesis is to observe the interdependency between acoustic scenes and events while utilising the power of explainable AI (XAI) on the task of acoustic scene classification (ASC).

## :open_file_folder: Folder contents:
  1. `audio_processing` contains python scripts for extracting panns inference from audio ".wav" files and log mel extraction script.
  2. "csv_parser" : contains jupyter notebooks of general analysis observed on scapper and tut18 dataset. The notebooks focus on exploring the distribution of events across different acoustic scenes.
  3. "models" has code setup for two types of models: Autoencoder(TAU2019_autoenc) and Acoustic Scene Classification(asc).
