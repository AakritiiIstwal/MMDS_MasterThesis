# MMDS_MasterThesis
:butterfly: This repository maintains the code for Master Thesis at Universit√§t Mannheim. The thesis is conducted under the chair of Artificial Intelligence and focuses on audio processing. The aim of the thesis is to observe the interdependency between acoustic scenes and events while utilising the power of explainable AI (XAI) on the task of acoustic scene classification (ASC).

## :open_file_folder: Folder contents:
  1. `audio_processing`: This directory includes Python scripts for extracting PANNS inferences and log-mel spectrograms from .wav audio files.
  2. `csv_parser`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for general analysis based on the <span style="color:green;">scapper</span> and <span style="color:green;">tut18</span> datasets. The notebooks are designed to explore the distribution of events across various acoustic scenes.
  3. "models" has code setup for two types of models: Autoencoder(TAU2019_autoenc) and Acoustic Scene Classification(asc).
